# Assignment2
This was an assignment I took, on successful completion of it I was offered an Internship from FYND(Shopsense Retail PVT LTD). 
#

# Problem statement:
Create Camera app in unity for android which has following features:

*Camera filters. Camera filter must be implemented in java code with the help of any of java libraries. You will have to write android plugin in unity to pass image from unity code to java code.*

*OpenCV integration to create a separate real-time image processing effect on the camera feed.

*Lens filter implementation on camera feed like vignette, clor gradient, etc.

*Some AR effects with the help of virtual objects. This features can be added using only unity.

Note: Use of ARCore/ARFoundation is not allowed.
